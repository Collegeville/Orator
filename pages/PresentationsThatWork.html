            <p>
                Presenters want their audiences to listen and take away the main message of the presentation.
                Furthermore, presenters want the talk to be so interesting that audience members will download related papers,
                buy a book or invite the presenter to speak in another venue.  A good presentation delivers the important message,
                is somewhat entertaining (but entertainment is not a substitute for solid technical content) and leaves the audience
                wanting more. Therefore good technical speaking skills are important for your career.
            </p>
            <strong> Fact: </strong>
            It is not too strong a statement to say that good presentation skills will open up a wide range of career opportunities
            (whether you take them or not is your choice). You will probably appreciate these opportunities
            when you have been doing the same job for five years and want to try something new.
