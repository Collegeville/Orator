                The vast majority of technical information exchange and decision-making
                occurs within and as a result of group discussion.
                Good discussion skills and awareness of group dynamics are critical for effective communication.
                Your success within an organization will be greatly influenced by your group discussion skills.
            </p>
            <strong> Fact: </strong>
            Good discussion skills, especially technical discussion skills will lead to more effective work environments,
            reduce wasted time and much better team spirit within your work environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong><em>Some basic discussion rules:</em></strong>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Come prepared:</strong>
                    If you are supposed to prepare for a meeting, do so. You waste everyone’s time if you are unprepared.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Show respect for others at all times:</strong>
                    The single most important attitude for group discussion (and in any human interaction) is respect for others:
                    <ul>
                        <li>All participants should be encouraged to speak, even if only to say, “I have no opinion.”</li>
                        <li> All contention in discussion should be thoroughly clarified.
                            Often contention is a result of misunderstanding not fundamental disagreement.</li>
                        <li>Critique should always be focused on ideas not a person.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Arrange participants well:</strong>
                    When possible, each participant should be able to see every other participant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Important technical ideas should be thoroughly discussed:</strong>
                    Much misunderstanding in technical discussions is due to an incomplete or incompatible understanding of ideas.
                    Make sure that key terms are well understood and consistently defined.
                    For really important ideas, you should be able to reach a point
                    where you can clearly describe ideas in the words of other participants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reach consensus when possible:</strong>
                    If a discussion is intended to reach conclusions, try to reach a consensus decision if possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Record decisions:</strong>
                    One of the participants should record any decisions made.
                </li>
            </ol>
